# BlackBean Vimeo - Activity Plug-in
BlackBean Vimeo (https://github.com/blackbean/moodle-mod_vimeo) is an activity plug-in for Moodle LMS Platform (https://www.moodle.org). It makes possible to use Vimeo videos as regular activities inside a course.

This plug-in was developed because many of our corporate clients were facing the same problem: They wanted that their students could only answer a specific quiz after they watch at least a certain fraction of the video. To accomplish that, we developed this Moodle activity plug-in that integrates with the Vimeo API (you may use the video's URL or just its ID) and uses its statistics in order to define the activity completion conditions.
