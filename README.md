# BlackBean Vimeo - Activity Plug-in
The BlackBean Vimeo is an activity plug-in for Moodle LMS Platform (https://www.moodle.org). It makes possible to use videos hosted on Vimeo as ordinary course activities.

This plug-in was developed because many of our corporate clients were facing the same problem: They wanted that their students could only answer a specific quiz after they watch at least a certain fraction of the video, or enable some other activities (including other videos) only if the student had completed the video requirements. To accomplish that, we developed this Moodle activity plug-in that integrates with the Vimeo API (you may use the video's URL or just its ID) and uses its statistics in order to define the activity completion conditions.
