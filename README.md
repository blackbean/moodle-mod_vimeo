# BlackBean Vimeo - Activity Plugin
BlackBean Vimeo (https://github.com/blackbean/moodle-mod_vimeo) is an activity plugin for Moodle LMS Platform (https://www.moodle.org). It makes possible to use vimeo videos as regular activities inside a course.

This plugin was developed because many of our corporate clients were facing the same problem: "They wanted that their students could only answer a specifc quiz after they watch at least a certain fraction of the video". To accomplish that, we developed a moodle activity that integrates with the vimeo API (you may use the video's URL or just its ID) and uses its statistics in order to define the activity completion conditions.

IMPORTANT: THIS PLUGIN ONLY WORKS WITH THE VIDEO'S URL OR ITS ID. THE EMBEDDED FORMAT IS NOT IN OUR RADAR (AT LEAST BY NOW =])
